<h1>About the Ethics of AI Society</h1>

<div class="mission">
The Ethics of AI Society of Waterloo is an interdisciplinary society dedicated to 
examining the philosophical, ethical, social, and political implications of artificial intelligence. 
We bring together students, researchers, and administrators to foster 
serious conversations about ethical issues involving artifial intelligence, consider the consequences of AI usage, and strategize potential solutions to the ethical questions rasied by AI. You can access our meetings by joining us in person or joining us online through our Teams group. Email us if you would like to become a member.
</div>

<h2>Our Purpose</h2>

<p>
Artificial intelligence is reshaping medicine, education, governance, warfare, 
creative industries, and everyday life. Our society exists to ensure that these 
transformations are guided by careful ethical reflection rather than technological 
enthusiasm or doomsaying alone. We seek an inquirer's approach that critically considers the issues, follows up on the doubts and questions raised, and finds testable solutions. 
</p>

<p>
We focus on developing frameworks for responsible AI literacy, public accountability, 
and democratic oversight of emerging technologies.
</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>

<div class="highlight-box">
<ul>
<li>Organize interdisciplinary symposiums.</li>
<li>Facilitate regular meetings to discuss on ethical questions raised by AI.</li>
    <li>Host panel discussions and public lectures.</li>
<li>Develop AI literacy frameworks for educational contexts.</li>
<li>Examine philosophical questions surrounding science, technology, and values.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<p>
We reject both uncritical technological optimism and reactionary resistance. 
Instead, we promote a normatively grounded, philosophically rigorous, and publicly 
engaged approach to AI governance.
</p>

<p>
Our discussions emphasize transparency, epistemic responsibility, and the role of 
human judgment in high-stakes decision-making environments.
</p>

    <h2>Our History</h2>

<p>
The Ethics of AI Society was founded as an academic society  in January 2022 by Dr. Matthew S.W. Silk, formed within the first ethics of artificial intelligence course (PHIL 228) offered by the philosophy department at the University of Waterloo. The society continued to exist following the course's completion, but remained relatively dormant until September 2023 while Silk co-authored an Ethics of AI textbook. Following the book's completion, the society began meeting to discuss issues raised from the project. Our first meeting as a public society took place on October 5th, 2023 and we have continued to meet ever since, expanding to a group with over a hundred members, including students, faculty, and administrators across three separate universities.
    </p><p>On March 27th the EAISW held its first symposium on the ethics of AI. The success of the first event resulted in a second two day symposium on November 21st and 22nd with a keynote address by Dr. Maura Grossman. In March of 2026 the EAISW will hold its third symposium at Wilfrid Laurier University with keynote panel discussion featuring both scholars and lawmakers. 
</p>
